## Hello! Welcome to my profile!

<!--
**jawadad/jawadad** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

My name is Jawad and I am currently a PhD student in Computational Biology at the interface of academia and industry. My PhD is a joint position between the Schapiro Group (https://www.schapirolab.com) at the University Hospital Heidelberg and GSK/Cellzome in Heidelberg, Germany. My expertise lies in analyzing and developing computational methods for large-scale biological omics data, including bulk, single-cell, and spatial datasets to translational and therapeutic research. Currently, my research focuses on leveraging the latest spatial multi-omics technologies to better understand disease microenvironments and propose novel treatment options.

Originally trained as a biologist, I’ve always been fascinated by the question: what separates a healthy state from a diseased one?
In 2022, I receieved a scholarship that allowed me to study between Germany and the Netherlands, where I began integrating cutting-edge computational approaches into my work. I had the opportunity to learn from multi-disciplinary people and contribute to projects involving novel therapy targets, including antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) in cancer.
