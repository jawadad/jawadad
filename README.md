## ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Welcome to my profile!

My name is Jawad, and I am currently a PhD student in Computational Biology working at the interface of academia and industry.  
My PhD is a joint position between the [**Schapiro Lab**](https://www.schapirolab.com) at the **University Hospital Heidelberg** and **GSK/Cellzome** in Heidelberg, Germany.  

My expertise lies in analyzing and developing computational methods for large-scale biological omics data, including bulk, single-cell, and spatial datasets to drive translational and therapeutic research. Currently, my research focuses on leveraging spatial multi-omics technologies to better understand disease microenvironments and propose novel treatment strategies.  

Originally trained as a biologist, Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by the question: What separates a healthy state from a diseased one?

In 2022, I received a scholarship that allowed me to study between Germany and the Netherlands, where I began integrating cutting-edge computational approaches into my work.  During this time, I had the opportunity to learn from multidisciplinary teams and contribute to projects involving novel therapy targets, including antibodyâ€“drug conjugates (ADCs) in cancer.
